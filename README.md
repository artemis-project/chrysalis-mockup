# chrysalis-mockup
This repo is a mockup of a potential Chrysalis Gui using PyQt instead of Swift and Qlift, because QLift isn't mature enough yet to use for something like this. Hopefully this will give us a good idea of what we need to have for QLift in order to develop chrysalis in swift.

# Running
You need Python 3.5 (or higher) and PyQt5 installed with your interpreter to run this app.
